There are already a lot of good JavaScript animation libraries on the market, each one with specific features, strengths and weaknesses. 
Each programmer and each project have their specific requirements, so sometimes one library may be suitable while other times it could not. 
Tweene is something different. It is an animation proxy: used as a wrapper of your chosen library, it may allow you to do more and better 
and it makes easy to switch from one library to another any time you want. 

Currently it can work together with GSAP, Velocity.js, Transit (CSS transitions) or jQuery.
