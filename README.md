# Tweene - JS Animation Proxy - ver. 0.5.1

__Tweene__ is a JS library that helps to improve your favourite animation engine, allowing you to do more and better.

There are already a lot of good JavaScript animation libraries on the market, each one with specific features, strengths and weaknesses. 
Each programmer and each project have their specific requirements, so sometimes one library may be suitable while other times it could not. 

__Tweene__ is something different. It is an animation proxy: used as a wrapper of your chosen library, it may allow you to

- write animations easily, thanks to its versatile interface that adapts itself to your programming style
- gain extra features 
- switch easily from one library to another any time you want. 

Currently it can work together with [GSAP](http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/), [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/), 
[Transit (CSS Transitions)](http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/) or [jQuery](http://jquery.com).
